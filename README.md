# Data Science Job Market – EDA Project

In this project, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Data Science job market dataset. 
The goal was to analyze job listings and identify the most in-demand skills in the data science field. 
Techniques included handling missing values, data inconsistencies issues, and visualizing trends and patterns in job roles, salaries, and required skills.

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Regex  
- WordCloud  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

##  Key Steps Performed

### Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values in categorical fields like job_category, salary_currency, company_size, and experience_level
- Removed inconsistencies and cleaned job titles 
- Standardized and preprocessed job descriptions using regex

### Feature Engineering
- Extracted keywords from job descriptions using WordCloud
- Grouped job titles and salaries by country, work setting, experience level, and job type
- Created new visuals like salary trends and heatmaps

### Visualizations
- Percentage of work settings
- WordCloud of the most common job description keywords
- Top job titles and their average salaries
- Average salaries by country
- Salary distribution by work setting (remote, in-office, hybrid)
- Salary trends over time
- Average salary by Experience level
- Number of Jobs by Experience level
- Heatmap of job title vs. experience level combinations

## Sample Insights

- Python,SQL, and Machine Learning are most demanded job skills 
- Data Scientists and ML Engineers have higher average salaries compared to others 
- Senior-level roles offer significantly higher pay, while most of the jobs fall under mid level experiences 
- Remote work is dominant in data roles, often offering competitive salaries across locations

> This heatmap shows the number of job listings for each combination of job title and experience level.  
> It's useful for understanding where most entry-, mid-, and senior-level roles are concentrated.
